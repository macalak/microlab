* Try to adopt and use Event storming techniques to identify Domain components
* There is a movement around what is called No Estimates. This is an approach that rejects typical estimation 
  approaches such as story points or task hours. It focuses on delivering value over controlling cost, 
  and not estimating any task that would likely require only a few months to complete.
* Customized Scrum with Kanban
* It is about people. Never underestimate the importance of hiring the right people with the right skills and self-motivation.
